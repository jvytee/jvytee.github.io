# Hello, world!

I finally managed to get my personal website online! &#x1F389; \
It's still missing a few things - mostly content, but also useful features like an RSS feed (in case anyone actually wants to keep up).

The parts you can already see here are mostly hand-written HTML, using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
However, I wrote my own little generator script that allows me to write a page in markdown and render it into an HTML template afterwards.
I know there are heaps of static site generators readily available, but I wanted to learn some javascript and get comfortable with the Node.js ecosystem.
The whole thing is getting served off an old raspberry pi literally lying on my desk.

I'm not too sure what I'll be using this site for.
Maybe I'll write about some interesting tech or side projects when I can find the time.
