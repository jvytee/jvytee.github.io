# Hello, world!

I finally managed to get my personal website online! ðŸŽ‰

It's still missing a few things - mostly content, but also useful features like an RSS feed (in case anyone would actually like to keep up with my sparse output).

## TODO
- Handwritten HTML, rendered markdown & tailwind css
- Running on raspberry on my desk
- Probably write about tech projects
- Let's see!
