      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>I finally managed to get my personal website online! ðŸŽ‰ <br />It's still missing a few things - mostly content, but also useful features like an RSS feed (in case anyone actually wants to keep up).</p>
<p>The parts you can already see here are mostly hand-written HTML, using <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> for styling.
However, I wrote my own little generator script that allows me to write a page in markdown and render it into an HTML template afterwards.
I know there are heaps of static site generators readily available, but I wanted to learn some javascript and get comfortable with the Node.js ecosystem.
The whole thing is getting served off an old raspberry pi literally lying on my desk.</p>
<p>I'm not too sure what I'll be using this site for.
Maybe I'll write about some interesting tech or side projects when I can find the time.</p>
