Panama City is an interesting city I didn't really have a clue about before visiting.
With more than 1.2 million people in the metropolitan area, it has its fair share of busy streets and traffic of course.

Since the city is probably best known for its proximity to the Panama Canal, it also makes a lot of sense there are _a lot_ of really massive tankers and cargo ships in the ocean right off the city.
We were able to watch them from up close when taking the ferry to the beautiful island of Taboga to enjoy some nature and beaches.
Even though I'm very aware of the industry's impact on the environment, I find big ships fascinating and found [VesselFinder](https://www.vesselfinder.com/) as a great tool to get an idea about what they are up to.
