After neglecting my personal website for quite some time, I finally managed to polish it a bit :tada:

The site is still statically generated by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) based on a few simple HTML templates and published via GitHub Pages.
However, I found [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) very pleasant to work with, so I used it to create a custom theme.

I'm intent on filling the blog with some content over the coming months (this time for real :wink:), so let's see where this goes...
