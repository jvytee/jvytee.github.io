While this website has been online for quite a while, it hasn't seen any content nor other maintenance since its inception.
I'd like to change that by using it as a place for publishing some travel photography as well as technical articles if I can find the time to actually write.
Maybe I'll also add a section on personal (software) projects in the future.

For now, it's got a proper domain at least. :D

Technically, Cloudsalat is generated by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) based on some pretty simple HTML templates and a minimal set of CSS rules.
Thanks to a equally basic GitHub Actions workflow, I can simply push new posts as markdown files to a git repository.
`zola build` is subsequently executed automatically and the resulting website gets published to GitHub Pages.

Stay tuned for more posts soon! :)
