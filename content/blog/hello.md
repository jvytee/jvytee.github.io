I finally managed to get my personal website online! :tada: It's just lacking some content as of now.

The site is generated by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) based on a few HTML templates and some hand-written CSS.
Since I haven't found the time to properly set up my Raspberry Pi yet, it is hosted on GitHub Pages for the time being.

Stay tuned for future content! :wink:
